Description:    Using the PHP language, have the function CoinDeterminer(num) take the input,
                which will be an integer ranging from 1 to 250, and return an integer output
                that will specify the least number of coins, that when added, equal the
                input integer. Coins are based on a system as follows: there are coins
                representing the integers 1, 5, 7, 9, and 11. So for example: if num is 16,
                then the output should be 2 because you can achieve the number 16 with the
                coins 9 and 7. If num is 25, then the output should be 3 because you can
                achieve 25 with either 11, 9, and 5 coins or with 9, 9, and 7 coins.
