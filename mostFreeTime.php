 * Description: Using the PHP language, have the function MostFreeTime(strArr) read the
 * strArr parameter being passed which will represent a full day and will be filled with events that span from time
 * X to time Y in the day. The format of each event will be hh:mmAM/PM-hh:mmAM/PM. For example, strArr may be
 * ["10:00AM-12:30PM","02:00PM-02:45PM","09:10AM-09:50AM"]. Your program will have to output the longest amount
 * of free time available between the start of your first event and the end of your last event in the format: hh:mm.
 * The start event should be the earliest event in the day and the latest event should be the latest event in the day.
 * The output for the previous input would therefore be 01:30 (with the earliest event in the day starting at 09:10AM
 * and the latest event ending at 02:45PM). The input will contain at least 3 events and the events may be out of order.
