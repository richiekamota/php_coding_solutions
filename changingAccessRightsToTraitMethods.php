Explanation and Education:
Trait PriceUtilities:

The PriceUtilities trait defines a calculateTax() method that calculates tax based on the getTaxRate() method, which is declared as abstract to be implemented by classes using this trait.
Abstract Class Service:

Service is an abstract class that serves as a base for service-oriented classes. It doesn't have specific implementations in this example but represents a placeholder for common service-related functionality.
Class UtilityService Using PriceUtilities Trait:

UtilityService extends Service and uses the PriceUtilities trait to incorporate tax calculation functionality.
The calculateTax method from the PriceUtilities trait is aliased (as private) to change its access level to private within UtilityService.
Constructor and Methods in UtilityService:

UtilityService has a constructor that initializes the price property.
It implements the getTaxRate() method to provide the tax rate specific to UtilityService.
The getFinalPrice() method calculates the final price by adding the original price and the tax calculated using the calculateTax() method (which is now private due to trait usage).
Usage Example:

An instance of UtilityService is created with an initial price ($u = new UtilityService(100);).
The getFinalPrice() method is called to calculate and output the final price after tax.
Key Points and Best Practices:
Trait Method Visibility:

You can change the visibility of trait methods when using them in a class by aliasing with as private, as protected, or as public.
This allows you to control the access level of trait methods within the class that uses them.
Abstract Methods in Traits:

Traits can define abstract methods (abstract protected function getTaxRate();) that must be implemented by the classes using the trait.
This ensures that classes using the trait provide necessary implementations for specific functionality.
Encapsulation and Reusability:

Traits promote code reuse by encapsulating reusable behaviors that can be shared among different classes.
By changing method visibility in traits, you can tailor trait functionality to fit the specific needs and encapsulation requirements of different classes.
Additional Considerations:
Method Naming and Clarity:
Choose meaningful method names in traits to ensure clarity and understanding when used in different classes.
Access Control and Security:
Be mindful of access control levels (private, protected, public) to enforce encapsulation and prevent unintended access to class methods and properties.
