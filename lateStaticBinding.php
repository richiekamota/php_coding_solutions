/*
Late Static Binding Concept:

Late static binding in PHP allows you to reference the called class in the context of static inheritance. This means static:: within a method refers to the class where the method is called (dynamic binding based on runtime class).
In the DomainObject constructor, $this->group = static::getGroup(); uses late static binding to call the getGroup() method of the subclass that instantiates DomainObject.
Abstract Method for Dynamic Behavior:

The getGroup() method is declared as abstract static in DomainObject, which means it must be implemented by subclasses (User, Document, etc.) to provide specific behavior based on the subclass.
Static Factory Method (create()):

The create() method in DomainObject uses new static() to instantiate the correct subclass dynamically. This ensures that User::create() returns a User object, and Spreadsheet::create() returns a Spreadsheet object.
Subclass Implementations:

Each subclass (User, Document, Spreadsheet) implements the getGroup() method to define its specific group behavior. This demonstrates polymorphic behavior based on late static binding.
Usage Example:

In the example, we create instances ($user and $spreadsheet) using the static factory method create() of their respective subclasses (User, Spreadsheet).
We then demonstrate accessing the group information (getGroup()) specific to each instance, reflecting the dynamic behavior defined in the subclasses.
Key Points and Best Practices:
Flexibility and Polymorphism: Late static binding allows for flexible instantiation and polymorphic behavior by deferring method resolution to runtime based on the actual calling class.

Abstract Methods: Use abstract methods in abstract classes to enforce method implementation in subclasses, ensuring consistent behavior across polymorphic objects.

Static Factory Method: Implement static factory methods (create() in this case) in abstract classes to provide a common interface for creating instances while leveraging subclass-specific behaviors.

Additional Considerations:
Error Handling: Consider implementing error handling or validation in abstract methods (getGroup() in this case) to ensure correct usage and behavior in subclasses.

Code Organization: Use abstract classes and inheritance hierarchies to promote code reuse and maintainability, focusing on polymorphic behavior and encapsulation of common functionalities.

By refactoring and explaining the provided code with late static binding, you gain insights into leveraging dynamic polymorphism in PHP, allowing for flexible and extensible object-oriented designs. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and design patterns to achieve optimal code structure and behavior.
