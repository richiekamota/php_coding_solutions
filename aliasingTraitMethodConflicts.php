Trait TaxTools:

Provides a custom implementation of the calculateTax($price) method, which returns a fixed value of 222 representing a different tax calculation.
Trait PriceUtilities:

Contains the default implementation of the calculateTax($price) method based on a private tax rate ($taxrate) defined within the trait.
UtilityService Class:

Extends Service and uses both PriceUtilities and TaxTools traits.
Resolves the conflict between calculateTax($price) methods from both traits using method aliasing:
TaxTools::calculateTax insteadOf PriceUtilities; instructs to use TaxTools's calculateTax method instead of PriceUtilities's method.
PriceUtilities::calculateTax as basicTax; aliases PriceUtilities's calculateTax method as basicTax.
Usage in UtilityService:

Creates an instance of UtilityService ($u).
Calls the overridden calculateTax() method from TaxTools trait directly via $u->calculateTax(100).
Calls the aliased calculateTax() method from PriceUtilities trait using the alias basicTax via $u->basicTax(100).
Key Points:
Trait Method Conflicts: When multiple traits used by a class have methods with the same name, conflicts arise. The insteadOf operator resolves conflicts by excluding a method from a trait in favor of another.

Method Aliasing (as Operator): The as operator renames a method to create an alias within the class that uses the trait, allowing access to the original method via a different name.

Trait Usage: Traits provide a flexible way to mix behavior into classes while resolving method conflicts and providing method aliases as needed.

This refactored code should effectively demonstrate how to handle method conflicts between traits using method exclusion (insteadOf) and method aliasing (as)
